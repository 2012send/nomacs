Description: image viewer with capability of syncing multiple instances
 nomacs is a free image viewer for windows and linux systems, which is
 licensed under the GNU Public License v3. nomacs is small, fast and able 
 to handle the most common image formats. Additionally it is possible to 
 synchronize multiple viewers. A synchronization of viewers running on 
 the same computer or via LAN is possible. It allows to compare images 
 and spot the differences (e.g. schemes of architects to show the 
 progress).
