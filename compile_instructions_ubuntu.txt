On Linux, nomacs should be easy to compile (following tested on 64 bit Ubuntu 14.04, but should work the same on all Debian-based systems):

Get the required packages: 

sudo apt-get install debhelper cdbs qt4-qmake libqt4-dev libexiv2-dev libraw-dev libopencv-dev cmake libtiff-dev libquazip-dev libwebp-dev git


Checkout the code from github:

git clone https://github.com/nomacs/nomacs.git

This will by default place the source into ~/nomacs


Go to the nomacs/ImageLounge directory and run cmake to get the Makefiles

cmake . 


Run make: 

make


You will now have a binary (~/nomacs/nomacs), which you can test (or use directly). To install it to /usr/local/bin, use 

sudo make install
